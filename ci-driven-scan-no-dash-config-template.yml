site:
    # Sets the location that Burp Scanner starts scanning from. Enter the URL prefixes as a list. If no protocol is specified, both HTTP and HTTPS will be scanned.
  startUrls: 
    # - https://vulnerable-website.com/

  # Optional detailed scope configuration. See https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/enterprise/working-with-sites/setting-site-scope

  # You can add other URL prefixes that you want to allow Burp Scanner to visit, entered as a list. The startUrls are already included automatically.
  # For example, you can add URL prefixes that are part of the same target web application but not contained under the startUrls, such as a subdomain.
  inScopeUrlPrefixes: 
  #  - https://subdomain.vulnerable-website.com/

  # You can exclude URL prefixes that you don't want Burp Scanner to visit. For example, you may want to exclude logout functionality or sections of your site you don't want to scan.

scanConfigurations:
  # Select from Burp Scanner's built-in scan configurations. Four preset "Crawl and Audit" scan modes are available to define how the scan balances speed and coverage.
  # For a list of the available configurations, see https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/scanner/scan-configurations/burp-scanner-built-in-configs
  # If you apply multiple scan configurations, the settings from these configurations will be combined.
  # If settings in two or more scan configurations conflict, the setting from the lowest configuration in the list takes precedence.
  # Enter the names of the scan configurations as a list. The names are case-sensitive.
  builtIn: 
  #  - Crawl and Audit - CICD Optimized

# Two application login methods are available; login credentials or recorded login sequences. Only one authentication method can be used per scan.
# See https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/scanner/authenticated-scanning
logins:   
  # See https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/scanner/authenticated-scanning/login-credentials
  # Enter username and password pairs as a list.
  loginCredentials: 
  #  - username: user1
  #    password: password1

  # To create a new recorded login sequence, see https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/scanner/authenticated-scanning/recorded-login-sequences
  # Save the generated script as a JSON file and enter the path to the file as a list.
  recordedLogins: 
  #  - /path/recorded-login.json

reporting:
  # You can ignore specific vulnerabilities for specific paths, to prevent a build from failing. Burp Scanner still looks for these vulnerabilities and records them in the results.
  # For a list of all vulnerabilities detected by Burp Scanner, see https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/scanner/vulnerabilities-list
  # Regular expressions are supported for paths. If you don't specify a path, the issue will be ignored everywhere.
  ignoredIssues: 
  #  - name: OS command injection
  #    paths:
  #    - https://website.com/path1
  #    - .*/api/v1
  #  - name: SQL injection
  #    paths:
  #    - https://website.com/path2
  #    - .*/api/[0-9]*

  # You can specify the scan report filename and the path the file is written to. Reports are in JUnit XML format. By default, burp_junit_report.xml and the scan container's working directory will be used.
  reportFilePath: # /path/report-name.xml

  # Set the minimum severity and minimum confidence rules used to fail the build.
  # If Burp Scanner detects an issue with at least this severity and confidence, it will complete with a non-zero exit code.
  # You can configure your CI/CD system to then fail the build.
  # If you don't specify these parameters, the default values applied are LOW severity and TENTATIVE confidence. 
  threshold:    
    # The lowest severity issue required to fail the build. You can set this as INFO, LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH.
    minimumSeverity: # LOW
    
    # The lowest confidence issue required to fail the build. You can set this as TENTATIVE, FIRM or CERTAIN.
    minimumConfidence: # TENTATIVE
